    <h1>LAB Specifications</h1>
    <h2>Registers</h2>
    <p>LAB has 256 registers. While the size of these registers is specific to
    implementation, they must be capable of storing at least 28 bits of
    information in order to encode all possible instructions. Standard encoding
    of instructions requires at least 32 bits and a binary encoding.</p> <p>Most
    of these registers are general-purpose, however certain specific registers
    are reserved for special use. The 0 register will always store the value 0
    and is read only. Any attempt to write to the 0 register will have no
    effect. The last register is the program counter. While it can be accessed
    directly, it typically should not be. The second-last register is the
    immediate offset register. When encountered by the CPU it will load the next
    cell in memory as the register's value and write back to it if necessary
    incrementing the program counter as necessary. To facilitate this the CPU
    will load at least the next 4 cells of memory for each instruction. Any
    register may be locked by the operating system using I/O instructions
    specific to implementation.</p>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>LAB runs on a heavily reduced instruction set containing only 16
    instructions encoded across 4 bits. These instructions are organized as 4
    sets of 4 related operations. The instructions are summarized in the
    following table:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Arithmetic (0)</th>
            <th>Logic (1)</th>

            <th>I/O (3)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>0</th>

        <sup>&dagger;</sup>The behaviour of modulus on negative inputs is
        specific to implementation.<br>
        <sup>*</sup>Get and Put instructions block the process to call the
        operating system. However the operating system may use particular calls
        which have execution times specific to implementation.
